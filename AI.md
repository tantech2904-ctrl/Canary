# AI Design & Reasoning – RegimeShift Sentinel

## 1. Role of AI in the Platform

In RegimeShift Sentinel, AI is not an auxiliary feature or post-processing tool.
It is the **core decision-making engine** that determines how the system observes,
interprets, and responds to potential failure conditions.

The AI is responsible for:
- Learning baseline system behavior over time
- Detecting probabilistic regime shifts
- Estimating confidence in detected changes
- Selecting the appropriate system response under uncertainty

The AI does **not**:
- Execute irreversible actions autonomously
- Override human decisions
- Make domain-specific semantic assumptions

Without the AI reasoning layer, the platform collapses into simple threshold-based monitoring.

## 2. Core AI Technique: Bayesian Change-Point Detection

The platform uses Bayesian Change-Point Detection (BCPD) to identify points in time
where the underlying behavior of a system changes.

Rather than asking whether a metric exceeds a fixed limit, BCPD asks:
“Is the data being generated by a different process than before?”

This approach is chosen because it:
- Detects gradual and structural changes, not just outliers
- Produces probabilistic confidence estimates
- Handles noisy, real-world signals robustly
- Enables early warning instead of reactive alerts

---

## 3. Uncertainty as a First-Class Signal

Uncertainty is treated as a **core signal**, not an inconvenience.

The AI does not make binary decisions.
Instead, it outputs posterior probabilities representing confidence in a regime shift.

System behavior is directly conditioned on this confidence:
- Low confidence leads to further observation
- High confidence triggers early warnings and mitigation suggestions

This design avoids premature alerts and unsafe over-confidence.

## 4. Decision Logic Under Uncertainty

The AI operates using a three-state decision framework:

### Low Confidence
When evidence is insufficient, the system enters **Adaptive Observation Mode**.
The AI improves decision quality by:
- Increasing monitoring resolution
- Refining baseline estimates
- Accumulating additional statistical evidence

### High Confidence (Approved)
When confidence is high and mitigation is approved by a human,
the system executes **safe, reversible actions**.

### High Confidence (Rejected)
When confidence is high but mitigation is rejected,
the system enters **Stabilization Mode** to reduce risk
while preserving observability.

At no point is the system passive or unsafe.

## 5. Human-in-the-Loop by Design

RegimeShift Sentinel is intentionally **advisory, not autonomous**.

Human operators:
- Approve or reject mitigation actions
- Retain final control over system behavior
- Provide domain context the AI does not assume

This design prioritizes safety, trust, and responsible deployment in high-stakes environments.

---

## 6. Safety & Reversibility Guarantees

All AI-suggested actions are:
- Reversible
- Non-destructive
- Logged and auditable

The AI is explicitly forbidden from:
- Terminating processes
- Modifying core system logic
- Making irreversible state changes

Stabilization Mode ensures the system remains safe even when actions are rejected.

## 7. Why This Platform Is AI-Native

RegimeShift Sentinel is AI-native because:
- AI reasoning is central to system operation
- Uncertainty directly influences control flow
- System behavior adapts dynamically based on probabilistic inference
- Removing the AI layer removes the platform’s core functionality

This is not AI added to a monitoring system.
This is a monitoring platform **built around AI reasoning**.
